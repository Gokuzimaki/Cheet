					<![CDATA[<p>For a long part of my life, I have always wondered why Lord Frederick Lugard amalgamated the Northern and Southern protectorates into what became Nigeria, immediately the people shouted &ldquo;<em>happy new year</em>&rdquo; in 1914. Even if he had signed, couldn&rsquo;t his secretary and the man whose name gave us Port-Harcourt, Lord Harcourt have read out something else?&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Why did his queen, Flora Shaw, give us the name Nigeria; a name that sourced from the phrase <em>Niger &ndash;area</em>?</p>
<p>&nbsp;Had she given us a name like <strong><em>Slaveria</em></strong>---probably from the combination of the words &lsquo;<strong><em>slave</em></strong> and <strong><em>area</em></strong>&rsquo;, would our fathers have done anything?</p>
<p>There must have been something wonderful about the people of the community where this whole thing happened.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<![CDATA[<p>18-carat-gold HTC One-crafted specially to mark the 2013 MOBO Awards. There were only five in existence, and at such a premium price (&pound;2,750), it&nbsp;was the most expensive phone HTC had ever produced.&nbsp;HTC liked the design so much it's now available as a colour option. So it's not pure&nbsp;gold but nice enough to sit alongside the silver, red and black models.</p>]]>

					<![CDATA[<p>With the rapid improvement and sophistication in technology, production processes have become a lot more automated. Manual handling in production of goods and service delivery continues to reduce as more advanced computerization empowers many production processes to do things unaided.</p>
<p>Many production machines and lines continue to churn out standard quality products, meeting the specifics, with extremely minimal defects as almost every aspect of the process has been programmed to deliver perfectly. All the engineer needs to do is just program the machines and monitor the process to deliver. The world has come that advanced.</p>
<p>Be it food processing, aviation, automobile, FMCGs, telecoms, office machines, home appliances and equipment, courier and logistics production and service sectors, there are extremely intelligent machines created and well programmed to deliver, superior and standard products and services at much faster rates.</p>]]>

					<title>WHAT IS CHRISTIANITY?</title>

					<![CDATA[<p>There is a widespread belief that Christianity is a religion! Religion is the effort and attempt by mankind to seek God and establish a relationship with God. Hence, with religion there are several types, beliefs, procedures and means put in place by mankind to reach God. A religious person thus believes all religions have the capacity to reach God and maintain a good relationship with Him.</p>
<p>All religions also believe in the purity and righteousness of God, hence, they all believe reaching God and maintaining a good relationship with him is through morals, keeping rules and regulations, being upright and doing the right thing and generally upholding the law of good conscience.</p>
<p>Mankind has over time developed this concept called religion due to an innate conviction and natural instinct that there is a supreme being somewhere, bigger and more powerful than man who rules and controls the affairs of this world; the whole creation and nature. For man to therefore feel safe, secure, happy and protected, he must seek the protection, goodwill and kindness of this Supreme Being, hence religion became man&rsquo;s answer.</p>]]>

					<title>The best way to run your business meeting in 2014 revealed!</title>

					<![CDATA[<p>In this super-fast age of ours, good meeting etiquette is a necessity if any business must come good.</p>
<p>Quite often, organizations hold meetings within which strategies and business ideas are analyzed. But all too often, <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/meetings">meetings</a> run longer than necessary and consequently fail to keep attendees engaged.</p>
<p>Whether you're meeting with partners, vendors or employees, showcase your boardroom brilliance with these meeting musts:</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp; <strong>Determine the objectives.</strong> A clear goal will set the tone for the meeting and determine its direction. Your goal should be specific and measurable. If you're expecting attendees to brainstorm, ask each participant to arrive with a list of ideas.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp; <strong>Ask yourself if a meeting is actually necessary.</strong> Meetings can be expensive. To calculate the precise cost, multiply the hourly wage of each person present by the length of the gathering. If your objective can be met through e-mail, conference call, Skype, or even a quick one-on-one discussion, skip the meeting altogether.</li>
</ul>

					<![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Many businesses today are under tremendous pressure and anxiety about where their growth will come from this year. Teams are meeting, putting together plans and strategies for success. Competitors are also planning on how they can take on a larger share of the market; deliver more in volume, revenue and profit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The dynamism and inconsistencies in the market and business environment keep making it difficult for business leaders to chest-beat about good profit at the end of the financial year. The quality, commitment and passion of employees also put a question mark on the likelihood of fully implementing strategy and delivering the expected results.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;Truth is, many people today are just going to work, doing their best and hoping for the best. Very few are actually confident about success at the end of the period.</p>]]>

					<![CDATA[<p>Many years ago in my days of paid employment, I used to work in a team of marketing experts with excellence driven, extremely intelligent and competent leadership.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In our Monday morning meetings, each one of these managers were expected to report on their various bit and obtain guidance, advice and support from other members of the team.</p>
<p>This experience was not a piece of cake; your report must be tight, accurate, flawless and coherent. If by any chance there is a gap in your report or an indication you didn't address an issue you reported efficiently, you&rsquo;re &nbsp;definitely going to come under severe fire and criticism by many members of the team, they won&rsquo;t stop unless and until our director intervened.</p>
<p>Consequently, these meetings became a much revered experience, for some of us it became an emotional struggle or battle as it were, we would work hard crossing the &lsquo;Is&rsquo; and dotting the &lsquo;Ts&rsquo; to make sure we&rsquo;re not the scapegoat of any of these meetings.</p>
<p>One of my friends; a colleague then had serious difficulty handling these intense and tension soaked meetings. Every time it was his turn to report his bit, he would immediately begin to sweat profusely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He would lose...</p>]]>
