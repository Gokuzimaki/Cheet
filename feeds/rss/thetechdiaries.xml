					<![CDATA[<p>18-carat-gold HTC One-crafted specially to mark the 2013 MOBO Awards. There were only five in existence, and at such a premium price (&pound;2,750), it&nbsp;was the most expensive phone HTC had ever produced.&nbsp;HTC liked the design so much it's now available as a colour option. So it's not pure&nbsp;gold but nice enough to sit alongside the silver, red and black models.</p>]]>

					<![CDATA[<p>With the rapid improvement and sophistication in technology, production processes have become a lot more automated. Manual handling in production of goods and service delivery continues to reduce as more advanced computerization empowers many production processes to do things unaided.</p>
<p>Many production machines and lines continue to churn out standard quality products, meeting the specifics, with extremely minimal defects as almost every aspect of the process has been programmed to deliver perfectly. All the engineer needs to do is just program the machines and monitor the process to deliver. The world has come that advanced.</p>
<p>Be it food processing, aviation, automobile, FMCGs, telecoms, office machines, home appliances and equipment, courier and logistics production and service sectors, there are extremely intelligent machines created and well programmed to deliver, superior and standard products and services at much faster rates.</p>]]>
