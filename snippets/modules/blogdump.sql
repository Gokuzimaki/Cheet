Every time it was his turn to report his bit, he would immediately begin to sweat profusely.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>He would lose coordination and coherence; he would begin to mix up his numbers and report sequence. In the course of reporting his bit, he would have apologized about ten times for nothing; he keeps using &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&rsquo; as punctuation and by the time he&rsquo;s done with his presentation many team members are confused and unsure of what he said or they heard; consequently the questions begin to pour and my friend would come under serious fire and pressure.</p>\r\n<p>Why I found this quite disturbing was the fact that before we go in for these meetings, my friend would have shared his report and numbers with me, we would have gone through it together and everything would be okay. But as soon as he begins to report, he&rsquo;ll make a mess of a good, well put together and accurate report.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;This probably used to happen to my friend simply because of his personality profile, he happens to be an evader, not a confronter!</p>\r\n<p>Personality profiles can be placed at times under two major categories; the evaders and the confronters.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Evaders are those who can&rsquo;t handle challenges, issues and problems. &nbsp;They hate trouble, and anything negative. &nbsp;They hate to face their challenges and problems confidently and consciously, they would always wish challenges, issues and problems would never occur or would disappear, they love peace at any cost; even grave yard peace.</p>\r\n<p>Confronters on the other hand are strong, confident and bold. These are objective people who honestly and objectively face problems and challenges and do all within their power to resolve or solve them.</p>\r\n<p>Confronters are not afraid of unpleasant situations; they are mature and strong enough to accept the fact that life situations can be rough and unfavorable sometimes, hence when it comes, they face it.</p>\r\n<p>Many intelligent, creative and useful employees today are perceived by their employers as weak, incompetent and unproductive simply because they are by nature evaders.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The purpose of employment naturally is to allot you a role, responsibility and charge over an aspect or area of the business so that you&rsquo;ll solve all the problems and challenges that may arise on that bit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>You are of course employed to solve problems and create value. But if you have an evasive temperament, you&rsquo;re likely going to appear to lack competence or charge over that role because you lack the nerve, confidence and trait to face problems and solve them regularly and consistently.</p>\r\n<p>This has little to do with your intelligence, skills or abilities; it&rsquo;s a personality weakness that must be dealt with.</p>\r\n<p>In today&rsquo;s world, many people are in shock especially in their social interactions over the behaviors and actions of people close to them with an evasive personality trait.</p>\r\n<p>Many homes today are in disarray and problems because the man has an evasive personality so when his relatives launch attacks and bring problems to his home, he can&rsquo;t effectively stand up to them and protect his wife and children.</p>\r\n<p>Some men hate confrontations with close friends and people they admire simply because they want to avoid arguments and quarrels, these so called friends begin to take advantage; controlling and manipulating &nbsp;these evaders making them do things they hate, go to places they hate, indulge in habits they hate and live lives they abhor. But wouldn''t resist; avoiding confrontation.</p>\r\n<p>Many beautiful intelligent and great women today have become prisoners of emotional issues; they are unfortunately attached to men who are troublesome, abusers and users. These men use them; use their minds, use their bodies and their monies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>They do know these men are manipulators and advantage takers, but they keep quiet and endure hardship silently because they hate confrontation; they are evaders by nature at the end of the day, they lose out.</p>\r\n<p>Many powerful organizations with great potentials for growth have sadly lost the required sense of direction and purpose. They keep losing their best hands and the opportunity for success simply because they have an evader as a leader.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>When an evader is at the helm of affairs, many senior subordinates begin to arrogate to themselves undue power, they subsequently begin to oppress and suppress other members of staff who unfortunately can&rsquo;t enjoy the protection and support of the leader simply because the leader is an evader; he wouldn\\''t want to confront these senior personnel.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A major problem we face even in Nigeria today is the huge number of intelligent, hardworking and profoundly good people who unfortunately are evaders. They know the right thing, they know what to do, they know how to solve our national issues but because they are evaders, they avoid any form of clash or confrontation with incompetent and insensitive people in power and unfortunately have to live under and obey the laws put in place by the less competent.</p>\r\n<p>My dear friend, for how long do you want to keep running away from your realities? For how long would you keep wishing away real issues and problems, for how long would you keep enduring unnecessary pain and frustration? For how long would you keep harboring anger, bitterness and un-forgiveness against friends, siblings, parents, relatives, spouses, your colleagues and bosses? Don&rsquo;t you suppose it is better to confront them, discuss it, resolve things and move on from there?</p>\r\n<p>Hitherto, you may be unaware of the fact that you have an evasive personality type but now you know, so please deal with it.</p>\r\n<p>Face your problems honestly and objectively, don&rsquo;t avoid or pretend about these issues. It is normal and general to have problems and challenges, it&rsquo;s not just you; it&rsquo;s part of living.</p>\r\n<p>When you opt to face your issues and confront your challenges, you become more confident, competent, stronger and self-reliant. &nbsp;You stop being afraid of unpleasant situations in your work place and personal life.</p>\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t let fear keep you low and your head bowed. You must look up and face every adversity with confidence and hope. You are up to the task; you can handle the job, the responsibility and challenge. Yes, you can do it.</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s time to set yourself free from that abusive relationship, that oppressive association, that intimidating occasion and that life of subjugation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Be factual, realistic, objective and truthful in confronting people and situations. Avoid sentiments, emotional dispositions and self-pity. Do the needful, set yourself free.</p>', '21, January 2014 04:56:44', '11, February 2015 13:01:12', 'Tue, 21 Jan 2014 04:56:44 +0100', 5720, 10, 0, 'TODAY-ON-FRANKLY-SPEAKING--CONFRONTERS-AND-EVADERS.', 'no', 'no', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', 0, 'active');

Many people with ideas, creativity, positive thinking, solutions and tenacity are becoming millionaires overnight. In this season you could be broke today and become a multi-millionaire the next day! It&rsquo;s a season of unprecedented prosperity and great wealth!</p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately, many of us today suffer from money worries more than any other kind of worry. Hanker and desperation for money by many stems from its lack, and has pushed people into all kinds of atrocities and illegalities because they are unaware of the modern ways to wealth.</p>\r\n<p>Those that don&rsquo;t have and don&rsquo;t want ill-gotten wealth have however remained poor and continue to endure a life of hardship and lack because; they are ignorant about the real modern ways to wealth.</p>\r\n<p>Truth is, the frustration and the terrible implication of not knowing how to access money has made some people perceive riches as bad and rich people as evil and selfish.</p>\r\n<p>But may I say to you this morning that irrespective of your perception and opinion, money makes people happy; money can facilitate better relationships, better families and good quality life.</p>\r\n<p>Money grants you access to the best things life has to offer. Money may not be the absolute key to happiness but having money makes you happy. You have better homes, afford better quality education, live in better neighborhoods, enjoy better health care, put on better clothing and enjoy respect and relevance everywhere you go. Poverty makes you unhappy, unpopular, disdained, disrespected, misused and abused.</p>\r\n<p>My purpose this morning is not to promote materialism or ostentatious living, I just want you to move up to that level where you can afford a good life, free from fear, insecurity and deprivation.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;I believe there are just some things you should just be able to afford in life, when you can&rsquo;t afford the basic necessities in life, it means you are poor.</p>\r\n<p>Affordable in my opinion should be how you should approach material acquisition in life, not the expensive or cheap approach. Cheap or expensive is an illusion, it only applies to the intending buyer; it is not of general market application. What you call cheap may be expensive to someone else. A fifty thousand naira mobile phone may be quite cheap for some people, they won&rsquo;t even bother buying it because it&rsquo;s too cheap and wouldn&rsquo;t suit their status, and some other person would save so much money for a long time to buy a twenty thousand naira phone. Cheap or expensive is exclusive to the purse or pocket of the buyer.</p>\r\n<p>But when you begin to think from the perspective of affordability, it&rsquo;s a thinking and a view that is progressive by nature, affordability simply means for now I can&rsquo;t buy it because I don&rsquo;t have enough now, but as soon as I have enough, I will buy it.</p>\r\n<p>This sets you on a progressive track towards better living standards in life. It delivers you from a mentality of poverty. A mindset of poverty holds a permanent opinion about expensive and cheap irrespective of how much they have in their pockets. Hence, they will never want to buy the best because to them it is expensive even if they can afford it.</p>\r\n<p>Dear friends, I want you to stop and think for a moment, what is your own definition of success? What does success mean to you? You see success is a relative term because we differ in our goals, dreams and expectations in life, but today I just want you to think again about what that point of success would be for you.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Becoming the managing director? Owning your own multi-million dollar business? Building your own house, building an estate?</p>\r\n<p>For me success is when I&rsquo;m numbered amongst the top five public speakers in the world; then I&rsquo;ll know I&rsquo;m successful. What is success for you, I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s obviously different from mine, and you can see also it&rsquo;s not really about money.</p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;d like you to do something today, go back in time in your life to maybe when you were fifteen or sixteen; based on what you know now, what choices and decisions would you rather have made in life? What different choices would you have made? What mistakes would you have avoided, what counsel and popular opinion would you have disregarded?</p>\r\n<p>Would you be in the industry you&rsquo;re currently in, would you have studied the course you studied in school, would you have married the person you married, would you have birthed the number of kids you have?</p>\r\n<p>I mean these are personal questions and only you can answer them personally and sincerely, I know for some of us having our spouses by our sides right now we would say yes to the question about whom you&rsquo;re married to, but the real answer remains true only in your mind, it is that personal.</p>\r\n<p>I have good news for you today, it doesn&rsquo;t matter where you&rsquo;re at right now, you can start right now to begin to take deliberate steps towards your success definition.</p>\r\n<p>Revisit your dreams of yesteryears and reawaken them, shut your mind to the popular declarations of hardship, lack, poverty and deprivation, these are not of global application, open your mind and see beyond your location, don&rsquo;t have a local and restricted dream and vision, to be truly rich in this world the whole world must be your market. Hey! It&rsquo;s accessible now through technology, you can do business globally now without leaving your house! Open your eyes, open your mind, don&rsquo;t allow infrastructural challenges, inflation and exchange rate make things look impossible. See a global picture and set your success dream on high, above nations and continents; never stay local.</p>\r\n<p>If you can start all over again what will your success journey be like?</p>\r\n<p>Dear friend, you can&rsquo;t hit a target you can&rsquo;t see. You must have a mental picture of what your ideal life and success and accomplishment would look like. This picture will protect you from a life of mediocrity and the temptation to settle for less.</p>\r\n<p>Make a master piece of your life&rsquo;s work, dream and ambition, remember you&rsquo;re older now than you were last night; we only live once. Take the chance.</p>\r\n<p>Enjoy your day.</p>',

Very few are actually confident about success at the end of the period.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">With the continuous growth in knowledge and capacities for business management and professional business practice, it is quite popular today to declare the customer as king. Marketers are quick to refer to the customer as king and as far as business success is concerned, efficient customer service is a very critical key to delivering the numbers.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Company-wide marketing orientation is also a popular advocacy with serious minded businesses nowadays. And this philosophy supports the prioritizing of the customer as the most important element in business practice; in fact without the customer, the business dies.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But overtime it&rsquo;s amazing how this business fact has lost its realism as it were - becoming a philosophy mouthed, advocated but denied in practice hence, no real impact and consequently no expected results.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">As a customer I have severally been exposed to sales people and customer service personnel who make attempts at satisfying me and at the end of the day just end up irritating me.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It&rsquo;s amazing how so many businesses today underrate and take for granted the intelligence of their customers.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Customer service ought to have the true ability to service the customer and satisfy the customer. Customer service is not just a set of activities wired into the process of making a sale, giving it a robust appearance but lacking in essence and the real ability to make customers happy.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Customer service is not supposed to be packaged in a way to insult the intelligence of the customer or compensate for product failure. Customer satisfaction should actually have the ability to satisfy the need and expectations of the customer.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Many marketers and sales team very much know their customer service and satisfaction packages won&rsquo;t work because it&rsquo;s actually cost led not purpose driven, it&rsquo;s also put in place as palliatives when the product or service fails to satisfy the customer, so they just do it for the sake of doing it; they know it will not make customers happy or satisfied. If the customer is truly the king, customer service shouldn&rsquo;t be compensating for product failure; it should actually be put in place to make sure the product or service satisfies the customer &ndash; the king.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In my submission, many businesses today are busy mocking, disrespecting and upsetting their customers; the king, because they are desperately pursuing profit, hence their customer service approach is purposed to compensate for their diminishing quality of product or insensitive price increases. This style can never sustain customer growth and loyalty, subsequently, with time customers would move.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In my opinion, I think a business organization consist of a group of persons brought together for the common purpose of creating and keeping customers.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I believe the primary responsibility of any organization is to create, grow and retain as many customers as possible, unfortunately, many organizations, out of desperation for profit sacrifice the source of revenue and profit; the customer.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Respecting a king goes far beyond bowing to the king and saying nice things and praising the king. Real respect for a king is in listening to the king and meeting his needs.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Every now and again I see many businesses miss out on this profound fact and gradually tow the path of subsequent decline and liquidation.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Immediately businesses sense a threat of an impending shortfall in expected revenue or profit, the first to feel the heat is the customer, how? Companies begin to compromise on quality and at times quantity and size of their products. If it&rsquo;s a tangible product, the size may reduce or the quality of ingredients compromised. If companies don&rsquo;t touch the product, they alternatively jack up the price.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The customer is most of the time the first victim when a business appears to be struggling. Where then does the marketing philosophy of customer being king apply?</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Dear friends, I believe what we see expressed at the level of organizations is a reflection of the thinking and the judgments of individuals team members.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Our collective reasoning, analyses and conclusions are what you find our organizations implementing.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">So much like the business, as individuals we have in and around our lives some individuals that are very close and useful, these are people who in time past believed in us, supported us, encouraged us and stood by us when it was as though we were struggling with our careers, capacities and general approval by the business. They supplied our emotional, psychological and competence needs at the work place.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">These people believed in us and saw what many others in the organizations didn&rsquo;t see, we enjoyed their protection, training and motivation and with time we were able to overcome our limitations, struggles and suddenly became super stars.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Suddenly everyone began to see our potentials, gifts, capacities and abilities and we became a major part of the business and we became more relevant and even became involved in decision making.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">We became the favorite of the company leadership and the leadership had our ears, what you say to the leaders, they believe and your counsel is quite valuable to them. Gradually you become more powerful, influential and strong within the business and you begin to rise.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Being comfortable with this new status of power, relevance and general acceptance, we become very protective of it and would do anything to remain trusted, relevant and powerful within the system.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately, if in the process of time that high and powerful position you occupy is suddenly threatened by situations and circumstances within the system or your personal ambition and profiting begins to drive you, the very persons or people that gave you the opportunity for ascension are the very first ones you deal with and hurt to secure your position or that promotion.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Those you once respected, revered and treated as king then become the very first you scheme, plot and strategize to sideline or even send packing in order to achieve your own ambition.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">What you fail to see or acknowledge is the fact that these same people who supported and helped you up can as well bring you down effortlessly by withdrawing their support, patronage and backing.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">No individual can stand alone and survive alone. And be sure those that groomed you and saw you rise know you better than your newly found allies and close supporters, hence, they know your weaknesses and know just where and how to get you.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Dear friend, loneliness at the top comes when you discard and do away with those who were there with you and supported you when you were still ascending. Just like the very first customers of a business are very important to any business.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Lack of confidence and insecurity is the only motivation for sidelining friends and contemporaries when eventually you feel you&rsquo;re at your top or achieved something worthwhile.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The fact that they know you in and out makes you uncomfortable hence you&rsquo;ll rather draw close to those who don&rsquo;t really know you and can&rsquo;t demystify you, don&rsquo;t you realize true help comes from people who can truly tell you the truth because the truly know you?</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Many businesses die today because they keep treating their loyal customers wrong when they experience a revenue or profitability threat by compromising quality or increasing prices. Eventually these customers who were there to support and grow the business from the start become disgruntled and disappointed and consequently withdraw their patronage and support for the business.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">What many businesses still fail to embrace is the fact that business survival and growth is about creating, retaining and growing customers not making profit. You can never be profitable without customers; chasing profit at the expense of your customer defiles logic and will kill your business faster than anything else.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Chasing your career goals and ambition at the expense of those who raised and trained you, will frustrate you and make you very lonely and overwhelmed at the end of the day and consequently you wouldn&rsquo;t last that long in that top position or office.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Dear friends, respect the customer, respect the king, respect those who make you, don&rsquo;t use or abuse your support, protect and preserve them, they will protect and preserve you in return.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;Enjoy your day.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>CONNECT WITH US ON SOCIAL MEDIA!</strong></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Twitter:</strong>&nbsp;@franklyafolabi or&nbsp;<strong>Click</strong>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.twitter.com/franklyafolabi">http://www.twitter.com/franklyafolabi</a></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Facebook fan page</strong>:&nbsp;<strong>Click to Like</strong>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.facebook.com/franklyspeakingwithmuyiwaafolabi">http://www.facebook.com/franklyspeakingwithmuyiwaafolabi</a></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Google Plus</strong>: Muyiwa Afolabi</p>', '22, January 2014 05:07:24', '22, January 2014 05:12:20', 'Wed, 22 Jan 2014 05:09:03 +0100', 468, 34, 0, 'TODAY-ON-FRANKLY-SPEAKING--THE-CORE-OF-THE-MATTER', 'no', 'no', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', 0, 'active');

The small town was exactly where the inspiration behind the country Nigeria came down.&nbsp;Subject to popular belief, the name came alive when some whites saw a native playing an instrument called &lsquo;DUNGURU&rsquo;. When asked to pronounce the name of the instrument, all they could manage was a battered remix and ever since, that has remained the name of the town.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;The capital of the Northern Protectorate from 1902 to 1916, many of us hardly knew that Zungeru was the father of Kaduna, Lagos and Abuja when it comes to being the national sit of power.&nbsp; .</p>\r\n<p>Zungeru was established by the Lord Fredrick Luggard in 1900 as a military and administrative settlement, with the aim of protecting the colonized area of the country from the then Northern invaders. The first organized military &ldquo;<strong>The West Africa Frontier Force</strong>&rdquo; which later changed to the present day &ldquo;Nigerian Army&rdquo; was setup in Zungeru</p>\r\n<p>Zungeru was Lord Lugard''s operational base until the capital of the North was shifted to the new town of Kaduna 1916 just before the end of the First World War. The Lugard cemetery lies on a hill just outside the town. It&rsquo;s a beautiful place to be buried, apology to the truth that the dead lay thousands of miles from home.</p>\r\n<p>The popular Zungeru Cemetery hosts the remains of some colonial masters who died in the struggle of colonization and pacification. To many Nigerians, the ancient town is noted as the abode of power as railway workers were known to have played significant roles in the political developments of the nation.</p>\r\n<p><img src="../media/multimedia/zungerus railway club.jpg" alt="Railway Club" width="373" height="219" /></p>\r\n<p>Owing to this splendid truth, it wouldn&rsquo;t be out of place to say that the vision of a &lsquo;<strong><em>free Nigeria&rsquo;</em></strong> was first conceived in this place. As a matter of fact, Zungeru is home to the first indigenous Governor General of Nigeria, Dr. Nnamdi Azikwe, who was born in Zungeru in 1904. Late Chief Odumegwu Ojukwu; the Ikemba of Nnewi was also born in Zungeru in November, 1933. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img src="../media/multimedia/zik and the family.jpg" alt="zik and family" width="269" height="281" /></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I would have loved to know the house of Ikemba&rsquo;s father. Sir Louis Odumegwu Ojukwu was indeed a parcel of brilliance. None, to me, but a diligent man goes on to become the founding father of the Nigerian Stock Exchange.</p>\r\n<p>However, it is only painful to note that the residence of the parents of these two great Nigerians have now been leveled. One can only manage to locate the sites.</p>\r\n<p><img src="../media/multimedia/download (1)_1.jpg" alt="Ojukwu Odumegwu" width="255" height="290" /></p>\r\n<p>Laid at this cemetery, among others, is the founder of the Boy Scout Movement, Sir Henry James Speed.

Nnamdi is the first son of his parents.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Nnamdi today is sad and very unhappy, he just got a letter again from his father living in the village and the content is most distressing as it appears, his father is cursing him for neglecting them in their old age a critical time of need.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">His father believes they&rsquo;ve invested so much in training him and making him a big man and Nnamdi is denying them the right to reap enough fruit from their investment in him.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Nnamdi&rsquo;s father is asking him to send home as a matter of urgency about 250,000 naira to fix a part of the compound fence that has collapsed, buy his mother&rsquo;s blood pressure drugs and settle the lawyer helping with a land dispute matter in the village.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Nnamdi has less than 80,000 naira in his account today. What can he do? What should he do? Steal from his company, take bribe or initiate a fraud? By hook or by crook? Pressure, unnecessary pressure; so sad.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the greatest challenges facing the productive generation in Nigeria today is what I call the backward investment of value.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Many young people today are working very hard and struggling to make ends meet. Unfortunately, they carry a weak conscience tied to a tradition of taking full responsibility for their&nbsp;parents and relatives at old age.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Instead of investing into the future to create a future of financial security and sufficiency for ourselves and our children, we invest more into an exiting generation; a generation leaving the scene that really ought to have made provisions for their future and old age but failed!</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">They now transfer the consequence and liability of their failure on their children.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This trend unfortunately is a major snag on the ability of Nigerians to create and grow wealth.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A typical Nigeria youth today is working so hard to cater for himself, his children and his parents and relatives.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">An average Nigerian youth is expected to carry the responsibility of three generations at the same time; a very tough call. Since he cannot adequately make provision for himself, his children and secure the future, at old age, he would also expect his children to cater for him and his grand children too - another 3 generations.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I dare say with this trend our nation may struggle to experience true and rapid wealth creation, sustenance and transfer.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Every wealth created by each generation is squandered by three generations. With this trend, the possibility of adequate wealth creation is unlikely. We will inevitably continue to blame the government and accuse government institutions and agencies for even our own responsibilities.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Every great and thriving economy is driven mostly by the private sector, the government only lends necessary support, in a case where the people expect the government to do everything, there&rsquo;s stagnation and poverty.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A successful career life is such that can transfer wealth to the next generation, not take wealth from the next generation.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is expected that every person should start career by going to school first, next become an employee, next you become self employed, next you become a business owner, then you become an investor then lastly a philanthropist.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In a nation where this orientation is lacking, poverty and stagnation is assured.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Many people today who ought to have become business owners are still in paid employment because they lack financial intelligence and money management capacities. As the money comes, it goes without any plan for investment. Many employees who have worked for 15 to 20 years today may begin to beg within six months of losing their jobs.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">They have no investments and money discipline. They&rsquo;ve wasted all the salaries earned over the years in emotional and sentimental expenditure. Today they have nothing in investment and reserve.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Take a moment to calculate all your income since your career began, how much has truly passed through your hands? What do you have to show for all that money today? Think about it.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Many employees today can&rsquo;t afford to resign, move on and create room for fresh graduates and subordinates to take over their positions, they lack the capital and financial security needed to employ themselves; that&rsquo;s part of our unemployment problems in Nigeria - sit tight employees.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Your children should not be your financial security for the future, if this is your thinking you&rsquo;re part of the problem of Nigeria. It is expected that a good man should leave an inheritance for even his children&rsquo;s children, not eat the inheritance of his children&rsquo;s children!</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Start thinking investment today. Learn how to make more money by making your money work for you. Get investment education. Even from that so called small salary, you can put something aside to secure your future!</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">You don&rsquo;t need every new shoe, clothing, bag, jewellery, car, suit, and phone, you really may not need a new laptop, electronics and party, must you go on that vacation this year; must you compete with people? Why impress or oppress anybody?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Think of your future today, because truly, it&rsquo;s all about you.</p>', '22, January 2014 09:52:48', '09, July 2014 11:56:57', 'Wed, 09 Jul 2014 11:56:57 +0100', 406, 47, 0, 'BACKWARD-INVESTMENT', 'no', 'no', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', 0, 'inactive');

For man to therefore feel safe, secure, happy and protected, he must seek the protection, goodwill and kindness of this Supreme Being, hence religion became man&rsquo;s answer.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But Christianity is different in meaning, purpose, context and source. While religion is man&rsquo;s attempt to reach out to God, Christianity is God&rsquo;s plan, strategy and purpose in reaching out to man.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Man was created by God in the beginning of time because God wanted a type of Him to exist for friendship and fellowship, hence in Genesis chapter 1 vs. 26, God made man not just in <strong>His</strong> <strong>image</strong> but also in <strong>His likeness</strong> &ndash; looking like God and being like God. And just as God rules in the Heavens he gave man a territory called earth to rule over hence he gave man the power and authority and commandment saying be fruitful, multiply, subdue, have dominion and replenish &ndash; the same five ruler-ship traits of God. (As demonstrated in creation)</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But man, through deception by the serpent, the wicked one, Lucifer; betrayed a trust, a friendship and a relationship with God and lost his Godlike nature died just like God warned him and man became an ordinary beast. (Genesis:3) His intelligence and ability to exist for ever remained intact though, but his God-like nature died hence, he could not relate with God anymore or relate in God&rsquo;s realm because through death in his spirit man he lost access to his godly realm. (NB: death is not a termination of existence but loss of access to a realm of life or another, mankind has an eternal nature, ability to exist forever)</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">God by his love for mankind now put in place a plan to restore man to his original position as a god.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">By the supernatural law that governs every existing realm and kingdom, blood is the price for sin (Romans 6:23, Hebrews 9:22), so God through his love for mankind decided to restore mankind to his original position as a god by paying the price so that man can continue to be like God on earth.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">God by nature exists as three forms in one (Father, Son, Holy Ghost) just like He created man too to exist as three forms in one (body, soul and spirit) remember we&rsquo;re in his likeness.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I&rsquo;m sure if you&rsquo;re familiar with witchcraft, you&rsquo;ll know they possess the ability to separate their bodies from their spirits when going for their spiritual engagements. The body is at home, probably asleep but the spirit is in a meeting in a different location and realm.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If ordinary witches can do this then it shouldn&rsquo;t be a wonder that God the Father also being in heaven sent God the son; the second person of the trinity to the earth realm in form of His son Jesus Christ to pay for the sins of man with his pure blood; void of carnal influence; a birth absolutely delivered by God&rsquo;s spoken word unto Mary just as he spoke Adam into existence in Genesis 1:27. Even Mary&rsquo;s blood didn&rsquo;t mix with that of Jesus as medical science has proven the blood of mothers and babies don&rsquo;t mix during gestation or delivery.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">So God came as Jesus, shed His blood, paid the price and restored mankind to the original state of being a god; godliness through faith and believe in His sacrifice!</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Christianity is hence, a state of spiritual restoration to that original condition of being a god, achieved through bloodshed by Jesus who repurchase the status and recovered the authority and power for man.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This is your experience when you believe and accept the truth that God died as Jesus and paid for the sins of mankind including yours. (The existence of Jesus was not terminated at the cross, he only secured a passage through death to different realms of life to recover power, authority and dominion for mankind from the enemy in all those realms as death is not a termination of existence but a translation from one realm of life to another)</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;Once you accept and confess this truth, your spirit that has lost its godlike nature and has become dead (loss of ability to connect with God&rsquo;s realm) immediately receives <em>spiritual signals</em>; the life of God. A reconnection is established and you become a god again &ndash; re-empowered to be fruitful, to multiply, to subdue, to have dominion and to replenish the earth!</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">So Christianity is God&rsquo;s strategy and provision to reconnect mankind to Himself, his kingdom and Spiritual network. This makes Christianity different and more authentic than any other religion. It has its origin in God not mankind.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Although over the years due to lack of understanding and complete revelation of this truth, many preachers have diminished Christianity to a mere religion advocating it&rsquo;s about morality, rules and regulations, obeying the law, dos and don&rsquo;ts. This is absolutely incorrect. It&rsquo;s about the life of God in your spirit man. It&rsquo;s about the god nature in your spirit.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">All religions are powerless against the forces of the wicked one, the devil, Satan. Infact many religions ignorantly worship the devil and his high powered agents. And the devil, through religion will want you to believe doing good and being moral is the way to be reconnected to god and go to heaven! He&rsquo;ll make you think your religion is unto the real God. The devil doesn&rsquo;t mind you doing good and being moral, infact he is happy if you think by doing good you are right with God.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Whether you do good or not, obey the law or not, it doesn&rsquo;t matter to Satan as long &nbsp;as your spirit is yet to receive the life of god through confessing and accepting Jesus Christ and you eventually go to Hell. All he is after is to ensure you go to Hell because as a mere man you cannot get to paradise or heaven; only gods are allowed in there!</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Christianity is NOT a religion; it is all about having the Godlike nature in your spirit by confessing Jesus Christ as your Lord and personal Saviour. This confession, this belief is what it means to be Born Again! The rebirth of your god nature! Hallelujah! Accept Jesus today and receive back your godlike nature to escape Hell!

All the engineer needs to do is just program the machines and monitor the process to deliver. The world has come that advanced.</p>\r\n<p>Be it food processing, aviation, automobile, FMCGs, telecoms, office machines, home appliances and equipment, courier and logistics production and service sectors, there are extremely intelligent machines created and well programmed to deliver, superior and standard products and services at much faster rates.</p>\r\n<p>The marvel adjoined to this innovation in manufacturing and production is the speed. What may require a hundred men to churn out in 30 days manually hitherto can be delivered by just one automated machine in 30 minutes. Hence, manufactures are able to produce more and deliver more efficiently in shorter time spans and periods.</p>\r\n<p>As exciting as this may sound, there are consequences attached to this rate of output. Of course the reason for production is consumption. Products are manufactured for consumers to purchase and consume. Though the quality and speed of production has been enhanced tremendously over time, the volume and speed of consumption however has not been able to match or equate production. Consumers don&rsquo;t consume at the same rate producers produce.</p>\r\n<p>Two basic factors I&rsquo;d like to consider, responsible for this are nature and purchasing power. I will not drink 20 bottles of soft drinks at once because the bottling company can now produce one thousand bottles per minute. Even if I want to I can&rsquo;t because it is naturally impossible.</p>\r\n<p>Similarly, I cannot buy 100 brand new cars at the same time because the manufacturers now have the capacity to produce 1000 cars in 5 hours. This is simply because I don&rsquo;t need that number of cars and I can&rsquo;t afford that number of cars. Even if I could afford, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense buying 100 of the same type of car.</p>\r\n<p>The immediate option for manufacturers hence is seeking new markets; new buyers and developing them, but most companies avoid venturing first because of the high cost of virgin market penetration, they&rsquo;ll rather compete in already developed and growing markets.</p>\r\n<p>Hence the improvement and speed in production technology has its own attended challenges.</p>\r\n<p>Besides the fact that product sales; that is offtake or purchases by consumers is far below the quantity manufacturers can produce per occasion nowadays, competitors are also producing as fast and as much products and selling to the same consumers hence, the ability to even sell most of what is produced by a manufacturer is made more difficult by the presence and activities of competitors also talking and selling to the same people in the same market. What&rsquo;s more, competitors may even be able to produce superior quantity and sell at a lower price if they get their value chain process management right and manage it more efficiently.</p>\r\n<p>This situation is inevitably the purpose and what gave rise to branding. Branding is basically the science of differentiating your product from that of competitors by making it recognizable and preferred among similar options.</p>\r\n<p>Branding is driven by the need to create recognition and a relationship with potential consumers; nurture this relationship and bond with the consumer to drive loyalty by fulfilling the promise made to the consumer by the brand.</p>\r\n<p>Branding is essentially in place to make the product the preferred amongst several options available to the customer. This can only be achieved if the brand lives up to its promise.</p>\r\n<p>My dear friends, branding is not just creating recognition for your product, recognition does not sell a product, fulfilling the brand promise is actually what sells the product.</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s really unfortunate nowadays to hear even experts think exciting product identity is what sells a product.</p>\r\n<p>For most establishments, their understanding of the branding concept stops at just the differentiation level. You&rsquo;ll hear people say branding is giving a product a name or an identity via recognizable elements like logo, colors and packaging.</p>\r\n<p>My dear friends, may I announce to you this morning that differentiation is a dangerous venture for a bad product or a brand that can&rsquo;t live up to its promise.</p>\r\n<p>Differentiation is not synonymous to branding. Being different offers the privilege of identification or recognition. When you&rsquo;re different as a product on a shelf or otherwise, I recognize you.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;No matter how lovely and fantastic and beautiful your differentiation is and no matter how poor and inferior the differentiation of your competition is, all differentiation offers me is the ability to recognize your brand and at best be drawn to it.</p>\r\n<p>True branding however is absolutely about the character of the product, my experience with the product and its ability to meet or match my expectations by fulfilling its promise to meet this need the way I expect it to.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;No matter the beauty of your logo, the colors of your envelopes and letter heads, the appearance and good looks of your business premises and employees, and even the excitement of your commercials, if my experience with your offering is disappointing, what your differentiation will do is to help me recognize and avoid your product the next time I go shopping for a product in your category.</p>\r\n<p>The character of your brand will help me form an opinion about it after an experience with your brand. When I try and it&rsquo;s good then I love and prefer it, when I get attracted by packaging and I try and it&rsquo;s bad, then I permanently avoid it.</p>\r\n<p>Differentiation empowers the customer to recognize you so as to either buy you or avoid you. Differentiation is not branding, differentiation is recognition, branding is an experience.</p>\r\n<p>Brand promise is the solution your product carries or the need its meant to satisfy, brand character however is the way and manner this need is satisfied. Brand promise to an extent is generic, all similar products will ultimately make the same promise in different ways, but the experience is what makes the difference, the experience of how well, how efficiently and how excitingly this promise is delivered.</p>\r\n<p>The experience in effect is what forms the opinion of the customer and determines if the customer would be back or will go to competition seeking the same promise but with a superior delivery experience.</p>\r\n<p>Dear friends, business success and profitability this year will be predicated on not just the beauty and class of your brand differentiation or even presentation, your ability to deliver the promise indeed in more superior and affordable ways than competition is the master key to market share expansion and revenue generation.</p>\r\n<p>Much like you my friend, your ability to deliver on your role, tasks and responsibility would go a long way in determining your empowerment, promotion and reward in this new season.</p>\r\n<p>This is beyond your nice suits, ties, skirts, shoes, hair, make up and good looks, it&rsquo;s beyond the ability to speak well and confidently, in fact it goes beyond charisma&nbsp; and popularity. At the end of the period, it is a matter of your objectives and appraisal. Were you able to deliver your objectives for the year? How well did you deliver these objectives; poorly, as expected, or exceeding expectations?
