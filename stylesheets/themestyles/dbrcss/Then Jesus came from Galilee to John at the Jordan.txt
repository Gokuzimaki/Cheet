Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan to be baptized by him. And he tried to prevent Him saying, "I need to be baptized by You, and are You coming to me?".
But Jesus answered and said to him, "Permit it to be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness". Then he allowed Him.
When He had been baptized, Jesus came up immediately from the water; and behold, the Heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting upon Him. And suddenly voice came from heaven saying, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased".
